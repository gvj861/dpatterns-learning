The Null object pattern is a design pattern that simplifies the use of dependencies that can be undefined.
This is achieved by using instances of a concrete class that implements a known interface,
instead of null references.

We create an abstract class specifying various operations to be done,
concrete classes extending this class, and a null object class providing do-nothing implementation
of this class which will be used seamlessly where we need to check the null value.
