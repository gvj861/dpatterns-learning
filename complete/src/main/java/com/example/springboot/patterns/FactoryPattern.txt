In the Factory Pattern, you can use dependency injection (DI) to autowire the concrete creator in the client code. If you're using a framework like Spring, you can achieve this with annotations such as `@Autowired`.

Here's an example to illustrate how you can autowire a concrete creator in the client code using Spring:

### 1. Define the Product Interface and Concrete Products

```java
public interface Product {
    void doSomething();
}

public class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteProductA doing something");
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteProductB doing something");
    }
}
```

### 2. Define the Creator Interface and Concrete Creators

```java
public interface Creator {
    Product createProduct();
}

@Component
public class ConcreteCreatorA implements Creator {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

@Component
public class ConcreteCreatorB implements Creator {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct() {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

### 3. Autowire the Concrete Creator in the Client Code

```java
@Component
public class Client {

    private final Creator creator;

    @Autowired
    public Client(Creator creator) {
        this.creator = creator;
    }

    public void doWork() {
        Product product = creator.createProduct();
        product.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### 4. Configuration Class (if needed)

If you have multiple concrete creators and you want to inject a specific one, you can use a configuration class or qualifiers:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public Client client(Creator creator) {
        return new Client(creator);
    }
}
```

### 5. Application Main Class

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        Client client = context.getBean(Client.class);
        client.doWork();
    }
}
```

### Using Qualifiers for Multiple Implementations

If you have multiple `Creator` implementations and want to specify which one to autowire, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation:

```java
@Component
public class Client {

    private final Creator creator;

    @Autowired
    public Client(@Qualifier("concreteCreatorA") Creator creator) {
        this.creator = creator;
    }

    public void doWork() {
        Product product = creator.createProduct();
        product.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this case, `@Qualifier("concreteCreatorA")` ensures that `ConcreteCreatorA` is injected into the `Client`.

By following this approach, you can autowire the concrete creator in your client code, allowing for a flexible and decoupled design using the Factory Pattern with Spring's dependency injection capabilities.


Note :

In the given example, if you use the configuration class to define the Client bean, Spring will automatically wire the Creator bean into the Client.
However, if there are multiple Creator implementations, Spring needs to know which one to inject.
Without any specific qualifier or further configuration, Spring will not know which Creator to use and will throw an error.
