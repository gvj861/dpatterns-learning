Yes, you can combine the Factory pattern and the Builder pattern in the same codebase, and it can be quite effective in real-world scenarios. This combination leverages the strengths of both patterns: the Factory pattern for creating instances of objects and the Builder pattern for constructing complex objects step-by-step.

### Enhanced Design with Type Safety

1. **Define a Common Builder Interface**
2. **Concrete Builders Implement the Common Interface**
3. **Factory Class with Generics**
4. **Client Code**

### 1. Define a Common Builder Interface

```java
public interface HouseBuilder<T extends House> {
    T build();
}
```

### 2. Concrete Builders Implement the Common Interface

#### CottageBuilder

```java
public class Cottage implements House {
    private String foundation;
    private String structure;
    private String roof;
    private boolean hasGarden;

    private Cottage(CottageBuilder builder) {
        this.foundation = builder.foundation;
        this.structure = builder.structure;
        this.roof = builder.roof;
        this.hasGarden = builder.hasGarden;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Cottage with foundation: " + foundation + ", structure: " + structure + ", roof: " + roof + (hasGarden ? ", and a garden." : ".");
    }

    public static class CottageBuilder implements HouseBuilder<Cottage> {
        private String foundation;
        private String structure;
        private String roof;
        private boolean hasGarden;

        public CottageBuilder(String foundation, String structure, String roof) {
            this.foundation = foundation;
            this.structure = structure;
            this.roof = roof;
        }

        public CottageBuilder setHasGarden(boolean hasGarden) {
            this.hasGarden = hasGarden;
            return this;
        }

        @Override
        public Cottage build() {
            return new Cottage(this);
        }
    }
}
```

#### VillaBuilder

```java
public class Villa implements House {
    private String foundation;
    private String structure;
    private String roof;
    private boolean hasSwimmingPool;

    private Villa(VillaBuilder builder) {
        this.foundation = builder.foundation;
        this.structure = builder.structure;
        this.roof = builder.roof;
        this.hasSwimmingPool = builder.hasSwimmingPool;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Villa with foundation: " + foundation + ", structure: " + structure + ", roof: " + roof + (hasSwimmingPool ? ", and a swimming pool." : ".");
    }

    public static class VillaBuilder implements HouseBuilder<Villa> {
        private String foundation;
        private String structure;
        private String roof;
        private boolean hasSwimmingPool;

        public VillaBuilder(String foundation, String structure, String roof) {
            this.foundation = foundation;
            this.structure = structure;
            this.roof = roof;
        }

        public VillaBuilder setHasSwimmingPool(boolean hasSwimmingPool) {
            this.hasSwimmingPool = hasSwimmingPool;
            return this;
        }

        @Override
        public Villa build() {
            return new Villa(this);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Factory Class with Generics

```java
public class HouseFactory {
    public static <T extends House> T createHouse(Class<T> houseType, HouseBuilder<T> builder) {
        return builder.build();
    }
}
```

### 4. Client Code

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build a cottage
        HouseBuilder<Cottage> cottageBuilder = new Cottage.CottageBuilder("Concrete", "Wood", "Shingles")
                .setHasGarden(true);
        Cottage cottage = HouseFactory.createHouse(Cottage.class, cottageBuilder);
        System.out.println(cottage.getDescription());

        // Build a villa
        HouseBuilder<Villa> villaBuilder = new Villa.VillaBuilder("Concrete", "Brick", "Tiles")
                .setHasSwimmingPool(true);
        Villa villa = HouseFactory.createHouse(Villa.class, villaBuilder);
        System.out.println(villa.getDescription());

        // Attempting to build a cottage with a villa builder will result in a compile-time error
        // HouseBuilder<Cottage> invalidBuilder = new Villa.VillaBuilder("Concrete", "Brick", "Tiles");
        // Cottage invalidCottage = HouseFactory.createHouse(Cottage.class, invalidBuilder); // This line will cause a compile error
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Common Builder Interface**: `HouseBuilder` ensures that all builders conform to a common build method, returning the correct type.
2. **Concrete Builders**: `CottageBuilder` and `VillaBuilder` implement the `HouseBuilder` interface.
3. **Factory with Generics**: The factory method uses generics to enforce type safety, ensuring that the builder provided matches the type of house to be built.
4. **Client Code**: Demonstrates the correct usage of builders and prevents misuse, such as trying to build a `Cottage` with a `VillaBuilder`.

### Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the correct builder is used for the corresponding house type at compile-time, preventing runtime errors.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Allows easy addition of new house types and builders.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Maintains clear responsibilities between different parts of the codebase.

By combining the Factory and Builder patterns with type safety, you achieve a robust and maintainable design that enforces correct usage and reduces the likelihood of errors.
