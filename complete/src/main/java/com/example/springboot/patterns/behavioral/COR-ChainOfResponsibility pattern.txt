Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler
in the chain.


To implement the **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)** pattern in production-level code using **Spring Boot**, we can utilize several techniques,
such as interface-based design, Spring's dependency injection (DI), and annotations.
In a Spring Boot application, the CoR pattern can be used to delegate responsibilities along a chain of handlers,
where each handler processes part of the request or passes it down the chain if it cannot handle it.

Let’s break this down step by step:

### 1. **Basic Design of Chain of Responsibility**
- **Handler Interface**: Defines a contract for handling a request and forwarding it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Concrete Handlers**: Implement the handler interface and contain logic to either process or pass the request to the next handler.
- **Client**: This initiates the request and typically interacts with the first handler in the chain.

### 2. **UML Diagram**

Here's a textual description of the UML diagram for a typical CoR pattern:

- **Handler (Interface)**:
  - `+ setNext(handler: Handler): void`
  - `+ handle(request: Request): void`

- **ConcreteHandlerA (Class)**:
  - Implements `Handler`
  - Contains logic to handle or pass the request

- **ConcreteHandlerB (Class)**:
  - Implements `Handler`
  - Contains logic to handle or pass the request

- **Request (Class)**:
  - Data associated with the request (this could be any domain object)

- **Client (Class)**:
  - Initiates the chain by sending requests to the first handler

### 3. **Implementing CoR in Spring Boot**

We'll implement a sample CoR for handling a payment process where multiple checks (fraud check, balance check, etc.)
need to be performed.

#### Step-by-Step Code Example:

---

### Step 1: **Define the `Handler` Interface**
```java
public interface PaymentHandler {
    void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler);
    void handle(PaymentRequest request);
}
```

---

### Step 2: **Concrete Handler Implementation**

Each handler will have logic to handle a request and either process it or pass it to the next handler.

#### Handler 1: Fraud Check Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class FraudCheckHandler implements PaymentHandler {

    private PaymentHandler nextHandler;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.isFraudulent()) {
            System.out.println("Fraud check failed.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("Fraud check passed.");
        if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Handler 2: Balance Check Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BalanceCheckHandler implements PaymentHandler {

    private PaymentHandler nextHandler;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.getAmount() > request.getAccountBalance()) {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("Balance check passed.");
        if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Handler 3: Payment Processor Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class PaymentProcessorHandler implements PaymentHandler {

    private PaymentHandler nextHandler;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        System.out.println("Payment processing completed successfully.");
        if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: **Request Class**

```java
public class PaymentRequest {
    private double amount;
    private double accountBalance;
    private boolean fraudulent;

    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
    public PaymentRequest(double amount, double accountBalance, boolean fraudulent) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.accountBalance = accountBalance;
        this.fraudulent = fraudulent;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public double getAccountBalance() {
        return accountBalance;
    }

    public boolean isFraudulent() {
        return fraudulent;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: **Setting up the Chain of Responsibility in Spring Boot**

Using Spring’s Dependency Injection, we can configure the chain dynamically.

#### Service to Configure the Chain
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class PaymentService {

    private final FraudCheckHandler fraudCheckHandler;
    private final BalanceCheckHandler balanceCheckHandler;
    private final PaymentProcessorHandler paymentProcessorHandler;

    public PaymentService(FraudCheckHandler fraudCheckHandler,
                          BalanceCheckHandler balanceCheckHandler,
                          PaymentProcessorHandler paymentProcessorHandler) {
        this.fraudCheckHandler = fraudCheckHandler;
        this.balanceCheckHandler = balanceCheckHandler;
        this.paymentProcessorHandler = paymentProcessorHandler;

        // Configure the chain of handlers
        fraudCheckHandler.setNext(balanceCheckHandler);
        balanceCheckHandler.setNext(paymentProcessorHandler);
    }

    public void processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        fraudCheckHandler.handle(request);
    }
}
```

---

### Step 5: **Client Code**

Now, we will use the `PaymentService` to process a request.

#### Example REST Controller
```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/payment")
public class PaymentController {

    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    public PaymentController(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/process")
    public String processPayment(@RequestBody PaymentRequest request) {
        paymentService.processPayment(request);
        return "Payment request processed.";
    }
}
```

---

### Step 6: **Testing the Chain**

You can now make a request to the `/api/payment/process` endpoint with a `PaymentRequest` JSON object like this:

```json
{
    "amount": 500,
    "accountBalance": 1000,
    "fraudulent": false
}
```

The expected output for the above request would be:
```
Fraud check passed.
Balance check passed.
Payment processing completed successfully.
```

If the request fails any check, the chain will stop at that point:
- For example, if `fraudulent` is `true`, the fraud check will fail, and subsequent handlers will not be invoked.

### 4. **Advantages of Using CoR in Spring Boot**
- **Loose Coupling**: Each handler is decoupled from others, and you can easily add or remove handlers from the chain.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each handler has one job, making the code modular and easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: You can dynamically set or modify the chain at runtime.

### 5. **Extending the Chain**
You can easily add more handlers to the chain, such as:
- Logging Handler
- Authentication Handler
- Rate Limiting Handler

Simply create a new handler class and chain it in the `PaymentService` or dynamically based on configurations.

This is how you can implement the **Chain of Responsibility** in a production-level **Spring Boot** application using dependency injection and modular handler logic.

Yes, you can move the common code for the handlers into a **base class** to eliminate redundancy. This will help keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and more maintainable. Here’s how you can do it.

### Refactoring the Chain of Responsibility with a Base Class

#### Step 1: **Create the Base `AbstractPaymentHandler` Class**

We can create an abstract base class that implements the `PaymentHandler` interface. This base class will handle common functionality like setting the next handler and invoking the next handler if necessary.


### Step 1: **Define the `Handler` Interface**
```java
public interface PaymentHandler {
    void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler);
    void handle(PaymentRequest request);
}
```


```java
public abstract class AbstractPaymentHandler implements PaymentHandler {

    private PaymentHandler nextHandler;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    protected void callNext(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handle(request);
        }
    }

    // Subclasses will implement their specific logic here
    @Override
    public abstract void handle(PaymentRequest request);
}
```

- **Common Code**:
  - The `setNext` method is implemented once in the base class, so all handlers can use it.
  - `callNext(request)` provides a common way for subclasses to pass the request to the next handler in the chain.

#### Step 2: **Refactor Concrete Handlers to Extend the Base Class**

Now, each concrete handler will extend the `AbstractPaymentHandler` class, which provides the common behavior of passing requests down the chain.

#### Fraud Check Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class FraudCheckHandler extends AbstractPaymentHandler {

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.isFraudulent()) {
            System.out.println("Fraud check failed.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("Fraud check passed.");
        // Delegate to the next handler
        callNext(request);
    }
}
```

#### Balance Check Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BalanceCheckHandler extends AbstractPaymentHandler {

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        if (request.getAmount() > request.getAccountBalance()) {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("Balance check passed.");
        // Delegate to the next handler
        callNext(request);
    }
}
```

#### Payment Processor Handler
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class PaymentProcessorHandler extends AbstractPaymentHandler {

    @Override
    public void handle(PaymentRequest request) {
        System.out.println("Payment processing completed successfully.");
        // There's no further handler, but we can still call callNext(request) if needed
        callNext(request);
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: **Simplifying the Chain Setup**

The setup code remains the same as before, but now the common functionality is centralized in the base class.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class PaymentService {

    private final FraudCheckHandler fraudCheckHandler;
    private final BalanceCheckHandler balanceCheckHandler;
    private final PaymentProcessorHandler paymentProcessorHandler;

    public PaymentService(FraudCheckHandler fraudCheckHandler,
                          BalanceCheckHandler balanceCheckHandler,
                          PaymentProcessorHandler paymentProcessorHandler) {
        this.fraudCheckHandler = fraudCheckHandler;
        this.balanceCheckHandler = balanceCheckHandler;
        this.paymentProcessorHandler = paymentProcessorHandler;

        // Configure the chain of handlers
        fraudCheckHandler.setNext(balanceCheckHandler);
        balanceCheckHandler.setNext(paymentProcessorHandler);
    }

    public void processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        fraudCheckHandler.handle(request);
    }
}
```

---

### Advantages of Using a Base Class
1. **Code Reuse**: Common code is now placed in a single location, reducing redundancy across handlers.
2. **Better Maintainability**: If the way we handle the next handler or any common behavior changes, it needs to be modified only in the base class.
3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The base class handles the chain management, while concrete handlers only focus on their specific processing logic.

This approach provides a cleaner and more scalable solution, especially when there are many handlers involved. Each handler only implements the specific logic it is responsible for, and the shared logic for passing requests along the chain is centralized.
