The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping an existing class with a new interface that clients expect.

### Key Concepts of Adapter Pattern

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects to use.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing class that needs to be adapted to the target interface.
3. **Adapter**: A wrapper class that implements the target interface and translates the client’s requests into calls to the Adaptee.
4. **Client**: The class that interacts with the Adapter via the target interface.

### When to Use the Adapter Pattern

- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the system.
- When you need to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don’t necessarily have compatible interfaces.
- When you need to use several existing subclasses, but it’s impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. Instead, you can create an adapter that works with the base class.

### Example: Real-World Implementation in Java

Let's consider a scenario where you have an application that processes payment using a `PaymentProcessor` interface. However, you have a third-party library that processes payment differently with a class `ThirdPartyPaymentService`. To integrate the third-party service with your application, you need to adapt it to the `PaymentProcessor` interface.

#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

```java
// Target interface
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Adaptee

This is the existing class that you want to adapt.

```java
// Adaptee
public class ThirdPartyPaymentService {
    public void makePayment(double value) {
        System.out.println("Payment of $" + value + " made using ThirdPartyPaymentService");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Adapter

The Adapter implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface and wraps the `ThirdPartyPaymentService` class.

```java
// Adapter
public class PaymentAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private ThirdPartyPaymentService thirdPartyPaymentService;

    public PaymentAdapter(ThirdPartyPaymentService thirdPartyPaymentService) {
        this.thirdPartyPaymentService = thirdPartyPaymentService;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        // Adapt the method call to the Adaptee's method
        thirdPartyPaymentService.makePayment(amount);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Use the Adapter in the Client

The client will use the `PaymentProcessor` interface, which now works with the `ThirdPartyPaymentService` through the adapter.

```java
// Client
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThirdPartyPaymentService thirdPartyService = new ThirdPartyPaymentService();
        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentAdapter(thirdPartyService);

        // Client calls the target interface method
        paymentProcessor.pay(100.0);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Target Interface (`PaymentProcessor`)**: This is the interface your client code will use.
- **Adaptee (`ThirdPartyPaymentService`)**: This is the existing class that you need to adapt to the `PaymentProcessor` interface.
- **Adapter (`PaymentAdapter`)**: This class implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface and uses the `ThirdPartyPaymentService` to fulfill the client’s request.
- **Client (`PaymentClient`)**: The client code uses the `PaymentProcessor` interface, which allows it to use `ThirdPartyPaymentService` transparently via the `PaymentAdapter`.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you have a smartphone charger (Target) that requires a USB-C port, but your older phone (Adaptee) only has a Micro-USB port. The Adapter is a USB-C to Micro-USB adapter that allows you to use your old phone with the new charger.

### Advantages of Adapter Pattern

- **Reusability**: It allows reusing existing classes even if their interfaces are incompatible with the rest of the system.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The Adapter separates the concerns of the client and the Adaptee, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Flexibility**: It makes it easier to replace or modify Adaptees without changing the client code.

### Disadvantages of Adapter Pattern

- **Complexity**: It adds a layer of complexity due to the introduction of additional classes and interfaces.
- **Overuse**: Overusing this pattern can lead to overly complex code and make the design harder to understand.

This pattern is widely used in real-world applications, especially when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems into new applications.


----------

In Java, several inbuilt libraries and frameworks use the Adapter Pattern to provide interoperability between different components or systems. Here are a few examples from standard Java libraries where the Adapter Pattern is used:

### 1. `java.util.Arrays.asList()`

The `Arrays.asList()` method provides a fixed-size list backed by an array. However, its return type (`List<T>`) is an interface, and the actual implementation (`ArrayList<T>`) is hidden. This method acts as an adapter to convert an array to a list.

```java
String[] array = { "apple", "banana", "cherry" };
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);

System.out.println(list);  // Output: [apple, banana, cherry]
```

### 2. `java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream`

The `InputStream` and `OutputStream` classes in Java IO use the Adapter Pattern extensively to adapt different data sources and sinks to a common interface for reading and writing data.

```java
// Example of reading from InputStream
InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
String line = reader.readLine();
System.out.println(line);
inputStream.close();

// Example of writing to OutputStream
OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(outputStream);
writer.println("Hello, world!");
writer.close();
```

Here, `InputStreamReader` and `OutputStreamWriter` act as adapters, converting byte-oriented streams (like `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`) into character-oriented streams (`BufferedReader` and `PrintWriter`).

### 3. `java.util.Collections.list()`

The `Collections.list()` method adapts an `Enumeration` (which is an older interface) to a `List`. This allows code written using older API (like those using `Enumeration`) to work with newer API (like `List`).

```java
Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();
vector.add("apple");
vector.add("banana");
vector.add("cherry");

Enumeration<String> enumeration = vector.elements();
List<String> list = Collections.list(enumeration);

System.out.println(list);  // Output: [apple, banana, cherry]
```

### 4. `javax.servlet.ServletRequest` and `javax.servlet.ServletResponse`

In the Servlet API, the `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse` interfaces act as adapters between the generic servlet container and specific HTTP request and response handling.

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
    out.println("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here, `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` are adapters that provide a higher-level API to handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Key Points

- **Purpose**: In these examples, the Adapter Pattern is used to convert one interface into another that a client expects.
- **Flexibility**: It allows components to work together that otherwise couldn't due to incompatible interfaces.
- **Simplification**: Adapters hide the complexities of conversion or interaction between different interfaces.

These examples illustrate how the Adapter Pattern is used in standard Java libraries to provide seamless integration and compatibility between different components or systems with incompatible interfaces.








------ EXTRA ------


To design an adapter that allows both `ClassicPaymentProcessor` (which already implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface) and `RazorpayPaymentProcessor` (which has a `makePayment()` method), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define the `PaymentProcessor` Interface

This interface is the contract that both `ClassicPaymentProcessor` and the adapter for `RazorpayPaymentProcessor` will implement.

```java
// Target interface
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the `ClassicPaymentProcessor`

This is your existing class that directly implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface.

```java
// Existing implementation
public class ClassicPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment of $" + amount + " processed using ClassicPaymentProcessor");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the `RazorpayPaymentProcessor`

This class is provided by the third-party library and has a different method signature (`makePayment()` instead of `pay()`).

```java
// Third-party service
public class RazorpayPaymentProcessor {
    public void makePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment of $" + amount + " processed using RazorpayPaymentProcessor");
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Design the `RazorpayPaymentAdapter`

The adapter will implement the `PaymentProcessor` interface and delegate the call to `makePayment()` on the `RazorpayPaymentProcessor`.

```java
// Adapter for RazorpayPaymentProcessor
public class RazorpayPaymentAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private final RazorpayPaymentProcessor razorpayPaymentProcessor;

    // Constructor for dependency injection
    public RazorpayPaymentAdapter(RazorpayPaymentProcessor razorpayPaymentProcessor) {
        this.razorpayPaymentProcessor = razorpayPaymentProcessor;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        // Adapt the method call to the Razorpay's makePayment method
        razorpayPaymentProcessor.makePayment(amount);
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Using the `PaymentProcessor` Interface

Now, the client code can use both `ClassicPaymentProcessor` and `RazorpayPaymentAdapter` interchangeably since both implement the `PaymentProcessor` interface.

```java
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using ClassicPaymentProcessor
        PaymentProcessor classicProcessor = new ClassicPaymentProcessor();
        classicProcessor.pay(100.0);

        // Using RazorpayPaymentAdapter
        RazorpayPaymentProcessor razorpayService = new RazorpayPaymentProcessor();
        PaymentProcessor razorpayProcessor = new RazorpayPaymentAdapter(razorpayService);
        razorpayProcessor.pay(200.0);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Interface (`PaymentProcessor`)**: Defines the contract that both the `ClassicPaymentProcessor` and the adapter (`RazorpayPaymentAdapter`) must follow.
- **Existing Implementation (`ClassicPaymentProcessor`)**: Continues to work as before, implementing the `PaymentProcessor` interface directly.
- **Adapter (`RazorpayPaymentAdapter`)**: Adapts the `RazorpayPaymentProcessor` so that it can be used wherever a `PaymentProcessor` is expected, by implementing the `PaymentProcessor` interface and delegating the `pay()` method to `RazorpayPaymentProcessor`'s `makePayment()` method.
- **Client (`PaymentClient`)**: Can now use both `ClassicPaymentProcessor` and `RazorpayPaymentAdapter` transparently, with no changes needed to client code.

This design ensures that both the existing `ClassicPaymentProcessor` and the new `RazorpayPaymentProcessor` can be used within the same application through the common `PaymentProcessor` interface, leveraging the Adapter Pattern to integrate the third-party service.
